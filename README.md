# social_lending_platform
A social lending platform that uses the Kym credit score system to create a profile for users, 
helping people in need of money connect with people willing to lend. 

The platform works like Yelp - Yelp helps users connect to restraurents near them, showing ratings for those restraurents. 
Similarly, the platform created helps lenders and borrowers connected, where the lenders get to see the various potential borrowers along with their credit profile.

Built this platform on the Kym system at YHacks 2017.

Features added over Kym - 
1. Social platform for connecting borrowers and lenders
2. GMail API for scanning emails along with SMS
3. Klout API to capture data from social media platforms other than twitter
